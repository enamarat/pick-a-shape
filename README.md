# pick-a-shape
It's another small project for my nephew. There is a set of colorful shapes on the screen. The goal is to choose the one that is mentioned in the instruction field. User must find the shape and click on it. The shape disappears after being clicked. After that another shape is chosen randomly among the remaining ones.
